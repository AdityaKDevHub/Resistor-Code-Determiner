# Resistor Code Determiner

> ## Description
> Ever seen a **resistor** being used in electronic **circuits** to *resist* the flow of electric current, and the colours printed on them in a specific pattern? Ever wondered what resistance, a random given resistor possesses?
>
> If yes, then you're in the right place. This tool, **Resistor Code Determiner** helps you to find out the resistance based on its colour codes. Just type the colours you see in your resistor to begin and Voila! You can find its resistance.

> ## Features
> - Convenient Usage of Program.
> - Viewable and executable on all devices.
> - Can help you find a suitable resistor if you have a electronic project on deadline.
> - Can help you surprise you partner(s) or friend(s) during a project.
